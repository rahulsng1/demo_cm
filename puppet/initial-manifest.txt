We will create the manifest for Apache httpd web server installation.

On the puppet master server, go to the '/etc/puppetlabs/code/' directory and create the new manifest file 'site.pp' using vim.

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/

cd environments/production/manifests

Create new manifest file.

vim site.pp

node 'puppet-agent' {
     package { 'httpd':
         ensure  => "installed",
     }
     service { 'httpd':
         ensure => running,
     enable => true
     }
 }

Now open the puppet agent server shell and run the command below.

/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test

The command will retrieve new manifest configuration file from the puppet master and then apply it to the agent server.

Open your web browser and type the IP address of the puppet agent.

http://<IP>/

And you should get the default HTTP page, if everthing goes well.
